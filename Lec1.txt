Don’t store in files because no relations between files
files to store light data , files can't relate data
DB: files in database in relations
Store in Hard disk: files (io) or database
Database are files in relations
Data VS Information ??   Data (resources) >> processing >> Information (results)
Database: Storing data organize to retrieve data simply
Database management system (DBMS)
Relational Database management system (RDBMS): Programs to store database
RDBMS programs: Oracle, SQL Server, Access (is weak), My SQL(what we will use) >> Vendors
DataBase : organized collections of related data
Design must with no gaps (no empty cells)
Design 4 steps:
1- Analysis
2- Conceptual Design >> Diagram >> using ER Diagram: Entity Relational Ship Diagram
3- Logical Design >> ER Diagram divided into tables,dataBase Objects
Normalization rules : to build successfully, a group of rules to check, like no gaps, in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity
Normalization: rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links the using relationships
4- Physical Design >> build DB on RDBMS

Conceptual Design >> ER Diagram >>Notations (Shapes) 

notations are standard
Entity (Object): Draw Rectangle (notation) with entity name inside notation
Relationship (Relation): Draw Diamond (notation) with Relationship name inside notation
Cardinality (type of relation): 3 types
	1:1 (one to one)
	1:M (one to Many), M:1(Many to one)
	M:M (Many to Many)
Note: in one add arrow

Attributes (Fields): Draw Oval (notation) with attribute name inside notation
Column in Database: Fields
Rows in Database: Records
Key doesn’t duplicate
Candidate key >> means key can be more than one, like: Id, National number 
	What I choice is called primary key>> make line under attribute name
	Note: trying key not being String, can add key by yourself, if more attributes we can remove unneeded attributes

manipulation means manteinance
ER diagram known as consid description

Weak Entity (notation : Rectangle inside Rectangle)> exist because has relation with main entity ,, ex: Employee(StrongEntity) & Dependent(WeakEntity)

Entity in Rectangle
Weak Entity Rectangle inside Rectangle
RelationShip in Diamond
Attributes in Oval
primaryKey in Oval has UnderLine
primaryKey can't be null

primaryKey of cardinality 1 redundant into M
ForeignKey (FK) can be redundant
ForeignKey can be null
ForeignKey is a primaryKey of another table
ForeignKey used to related table

primaryKey of cardinality 1 redundant into 1

primaryKey of cardinality M:N make table of 2 ForeignKey >> this table called Link/Join/Associate table

Select more than one record >called > Selection
Select more than one field > called > Projection

Normalization : organize data in database ,, not redundance
1NF : First Normal Form
2NF
3NF
4NF
5NF
BCNF : Boyce-Codd Normal Form
DK/NF : Domain-Key Normal Form

1NF : No multivalue attribute
2NF : No partial dependencies
3NF : No transitive dependencies
